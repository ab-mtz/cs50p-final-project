PDF to ICS - Worktime planning

Some jobs require differents shifts that are different every week, that gives possibility to people to mistake a shift in a certain day.
One of the easiest tools that we have availible are cellphones where a Calendar app is always installed. 

In my current job we get a weekley worktime plan from the system, wich only can be stored as a pdf and/or printed. Thant makes the task of registring our shifts manually in our cellphones tedious. 
The generated pdf have an specific structure given from the system, that means that this program will only work for it and not for other documents.
